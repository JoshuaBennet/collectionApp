# collectionApp
This application is to strengthen my understanding of SQL databases and HTML/CSS. 
The application stores dungeons and dragons races for view and allows the addition of new races.
The technologies I have used would be: 
HTML
CSS
SQL
PHP
To use this application you can view the information on the main page, and add new races by clicking ADD NEW RACE button.
